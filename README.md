## Abstract

 Abstract pending

## Replication

This repository computes returns for multiple years of the HRS using the RAND longitudinal version of the survey data. In order, the files "long_merge_in.do", "long_merge_in_trust.do", "prep_controls_income.do", "reg_inc_trust_2020.do", and "reg_ret_trust_2020.do" will replicate the analysis for comparing 2022 returns and 2020 income measures to 2020 measures of trust. From there, the naming conventions are explanatory regarding the .do files which compute returns for previous waves. (W.I.P)
