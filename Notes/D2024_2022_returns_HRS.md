1. Replicate measure of returns to net worth using PSID 2019
$$ r_t = \frac{y^c_t + cg_t -y^d_t}{A_{t-1} + .5F_t} $$

* $y^c_t$ interest income and dividends per asset class


* $cg_t$ from business, rents,  stocks,  real  estate,  pension/IRA 
$$ cg_t^{class} = (V_t^{class} - V_{t-1}^{class}) - F_t^{class}  $$

    * private business

* y^d_t payments on debt (reported payments)
    for mortgages, use  $$ Annual payment \equiv 12 * Payment = principal * \frac{r (1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n - 1}$$ , where n is number of months and r is the monthly interest rate
    

* A_{t-1} total net wealth at beginning of previous period (A_{2020} to compute r_{2022})
