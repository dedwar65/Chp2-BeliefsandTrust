## Household Retirement Survey (HRS) variable counterparts

Trust module is only present in 2020.

Here are the variables on the RHS of the regression for the income-trust relationship:

* Education: RB014, RB015, RB016, RZ216
* Age: RA019
* Gender: RX060_R
* Employment: RJ005M1, RJ005M2, RJ005M3, RJ005M4, RJ005M5, RJ020
* marital status
* immigration status

Here are the variables on the RHS of the regression for returrns to identify the persistent component from D2024:

* age
* education,
* employment
* year and state dummies (tentative)  
* share of wealth allocated to different asset classes
* leverage of mortgage and other debt
* wealth percentiles.

Here are the variables on the RHS of the regression for returrns to identify the persistent component from F2020:

* age
* years of education
* marital status
* employment status
* Dummies for individual wealth percentiles
* dummies for county and time

After collecting these controls, we need to add trust to the RHS and possibly allow for fixed effects if we use multiple years of data.
