                Although we have finished the interview, we would like to
                have you do a few simple tests for us.  We are interested
                in how these relate to some of the medical conditions we
                have asked you about in the interview.  One is a breathing
                test, and the other is a test of hand strength.


                LUNG FUNCTION
                
                MA1.    First, I'm going to ask you to perform a simple test
                that will measure how fast you can expel air from your
                lungs.  When you blow into this instrument [SHOW INSTRUMENT]
                the value of the biggest, fastest "huff" of air that you can
                expel will be recorded.  It is important that you blow as
                hard and as fast as you can.  I would like you to perform
                the test three times. I'll ask you to stand up.  Take as
                deep a breath as possible.  Open your mouth and close your
                lips firmly around the outside of the mouthpiece, and then
                blow as hard and as fast as you can into the mouthpiece.
                Like this...
            
                        [Demonstrate, then change to a clean mouthpiece and
                        hand instrument to R.  Be sure R holds the
                        instrument lightly.  The slot should face away from
                        the hand so that R's fingers do not obstruct the
                        slot.]
                   
                        [Once R has completed the procedure, record the
                        value indicated by the marker.  Reset the marker and
                        ask R to repeat the procedure.  Emphasize that R is
                        to blow as hard and as fast as he/she can.]

        9007    MA4.    For the second exercise, I am going to use this
                        instrument (SHOW DYNAMOMETER) to test the strength
                        of the hand that you feel is strongest.
                   
                        However, if you have had any surgery on your arm or
                        hand in the last 3 months, you should not do this
                        exercise.  Have you had any such surgery in the last
                        three months?

                in the hand that you think is stronger, grabbing both pieces
                of metal together.  Hold your forearm parallel to the floor,
                like this.  When I say squeeze, squeeze as hard as you can.
                You don't have to keep on squeezing.  The two pieces of
                metal will not move, but the dial will show the force of
                your grip.  [DEMONSTRATE.]  I will ask you to do this three
                times, stopping in between to reset the instrument.  If you
                feel any pain or discomfort, tell me and we will stop.

                Although we have finished the interview, we would like to
                ask you a few additional experimental questions.  They are
                very similar to questions we have already asked you, but
                researchers are interested in how people respond when
                the questions are changed just a little.  These questions
                are about how well you are able to do certain activities --
                by yourself and without using special equipment.

        MC1.    Although we have finished the interview, we would
                like to ask you a few additional experimental questions.
                They are very similar to questions we have already asked
                you, but researchers are interested in how people respond
                when the questions are changed just a little.  I'd like to
                ask about your ability to do certain activities without
                help.  By help, I mean either the help of another person,
                including people who live with you, or the help of special
                equipment.
                   
                [IWER: If the person cannot or does not do an activity
                listed below, mark the "yes" box for that activity.  If
                apparent by observation, mark the "yes" box without asking.]

                Although we have finished the interview, we would like to
                ask you a few additional experimental questions.  [They are
                very similar to questions we have already asked, but
                researchers are interested in how people respond when the
                questions are changed just a little.]

                you to tell me how much you agree or disagree with each
                statement as it applies to you -- strongly agree, agree,
                disagree, or strongly disagree.  Here is the first
                statement ...

                Although we have finished the interview, we would like to
                ask you a few additional experimental questions.  [They are
                very similar to questions we have already asked, but
                researchers are interested in how people respond when
                the questions are changed just a little.]
            

                We would like to know something about the work opportunities
                you would have if you were to leave your present job.
                Please answer the following questions on a scale of zero to
                ten, where zero means absolutely no chance and ten means
                absolutely certain.

                        find a job with the same number of weekly hours as
                        your present job, but one that pays 20 percent more
                        per hour?
